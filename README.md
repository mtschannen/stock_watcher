## Description
This is a ruby on rails app that I built to be a dashboard for saving and tracking stocks. I utilized the yahoo finance API to retrieve data in as JSON objects, then used the D3 JavaScript library to parse the information and generate graphs with customizable timeframes and a tooltip for examining specific datapoints. Additionally, I implemented a method of calulating the intrinsic values of stocks, and a database to store these calcuations over time. I also implemented Cerner's internal Oauth API, however I've removed that code on this public github for security purposes. [Demo Link](https://youtu.be/WXgTW3x6k0s)
